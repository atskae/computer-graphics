## Directional Light

**Directional light** are light sources that are percieved to be *infinitely* far away. The rays from these light sources are all parallel and are always in the same direction, regardless of where the light source is (therefore, it's position is irrelevant). An example is the sun. The directional light's direction vector is the same for every object in the scene.

I set the diffuse setting to max to exaggerate the shadows more.

Directional light vector pointing down:

Directional light vector pointing up (simply make the y value positive):

Cool!! ☀️
