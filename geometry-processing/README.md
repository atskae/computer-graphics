# Geometry Processing

Notes on the topic of geometry processing ðŸ”º

## Applications

* Product design and prototyping
* Manufacturing, 3D printing
* Medicine, scanning and 3D reconstruction
* Architecture
* Digital cultural preservation (3D scans of cultural artifacts)
* Geography, urban planning
* Apparel design, virtual fashion

## Topics

* Representing shapes
  * Parametric curves
  * Implicit surfaces
  * Polygonal meshes
* Shape acquisition
  * Scanning/imaging
  * Reconstruction
* Differential geometry
* Digital geometry processing
* Parameterization (3D object -> 2D representation)
* Interactively create/modify shapes
  * Skinning, animation
