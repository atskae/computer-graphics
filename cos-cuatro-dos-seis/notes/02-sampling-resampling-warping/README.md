# Sampling, Resampling, and Warping

~~Gonna try notebook and pen for this one... Except for adding links.~~ Ok nevermind hmmm need a besser System.
## Parametric Mappings

Operations on image with dimensions `(u, v)`:
* Scale by a `factor`
```
x = factor * u
y = factor * v
```

* Rotation ()
```
x = u*cos(Œ∏) - vsin(Œ∏)
y = usin(Œ∏) + vcos(Œ∏)
```

(Ok this was just an excuse to draw a penguin omg so cuute „ÅÇ„ÅÇ„ÅÇ„ÅÇ„ÅÇ!!!!! I wasted a good 30 minutes just looking at cute penguin pictures uhhg so cute„ÄÄ„ÅÇÁ¨ëOTL)

The math comes from the [rotation matrix that we derived months ago](https://github.com/atskae/computer-graphics/tree/master/scratch-a-pixel/notes/02-geometry/04-matrices#the-rotation-matrix)!!! üò≤ It all makes sense... amazing üò≠

Some actual math example

## Temporal Aliasing
Can make an object that is moving in a cycling motion suspended in air.

* [Stroboscopic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroboscopic_effect#:~:text=The%20stroboscopic%20effect%20is%20a,the%20period%20of%20the%20motion.)
  * Illuminate/display objects at a certain frequency relative to the object's motion to create visual illusions
  * [Wagon wheel effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon-wheel_effect)
    * A wheel appears to be rotating backwards

Flickering

## Spectral Analysis
* Spacial domain, frequency domain
* Any signal can be written as a sum of periodic functions
* Fourier transform (3b1b ‚ù§Ô∏è)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)
    * *Center of mass* is the average position of all parts in a system

* [Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem)

* [`sinc(x)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_function) (NOT a typo of `sine(x)` OTL)
