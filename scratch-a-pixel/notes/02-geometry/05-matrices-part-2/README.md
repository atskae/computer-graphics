## Relationship Between Matrices and Coordinate Systems
Each row in a rotation matrix defines the *vector* that describes axis itself, with its direction in the positive direction). The vector in the first row corresponds to the x-axis, the second row corresponds to the y-axis, and the third row corresponds to the z-axis.

If we plug in `theta=0` into the matrix that rotates around the z-axis, `R_z`, we can see that each row describe a point in the coordinate system which indicates the positive direction of the axis:

When we apply a rotation to `R_z`, the axes (which are vectors) also rotate around the z-axis, and the matrix entries are redefined as such.

For example, if we rotated 90 degrees (`pi/2`) counterclockwise, the axes also rotate 90 degrees:

Some observations:
* We are rotating around the z-axis, so the direction of the z-axis is unchanged
* The x-axis vector (which points in the positive direction) rotated from `P_x(1,0,0)` to `P_x'(0,1,0)` after the 90-degree rotation.
* The y-axis vector (which points in the positive direction) rotated from `P_y(0,1,0)` to `P_y'(-1,0,0)` after the 90-degree rotation


This works for any rotation matrix. Let's try doing something similar to the `R_y` matrix (the matrix that rotates points around the y-axis).

The `R_y(0)` looks exactly like `R_z(0)` above ðŸ¤¯.

Let's apply a `-pi` rotation (`-180` degrees = `180` *clockwise* rotation).

![Applying a 180 clockwise rotation around the y-axis](images/rotate-around-y-180-clockwise.png)

Some observations:
* We are rotating around the y-axis, so the direction of the y-axis is unchanged
* The x-axis vector rotated from `P_x(1,0,0)` to `P_x'(-1,0,0)` after the 180-degree *clockwise* rotation.
* The z-axis vector rotated from `P_z(0,0,1)` to `P_z'(0,0,-1)` after the 180-degree clockwise rotation

Key Ideas
* Each row in the matrix contains a *vector* which defines an axis (or the bases) of a coordinate system
  * This is important when we want to convert to different coordinate systems (change of basis)
    * To do this we replace each row with the axes (vectors) of the target coordinate system
* Matrices are just a way to store the coordinate system
  * The matrix is sometimes called the **orientation matrix**

### Unimportant Rant
It took me three days to understand what the f they were talking about this part. Why no use pictures?!

![CG education needs work](images/table-flip.png)

They (scratchapixel) actually don't say anything about the row describing the positive direction of the axis, that was just an observation I had. Maybe it's an incorrect fact, who knows...

I guess the benefit of poor explanations is that they force me to actually *try* to understand the concept, draw things out and play around with the theory myself by plugging and chugging in numbers... and figure it out myself.

I think the concept described above is called *passive rotation*? They could have mentioned that at least...
