## A Gentle Introduction to Computer Graphics Programming
* We live in a 3D world, but our **vision** views this world in 2D (images, flat screen, mirror)
  * **Foreshortening** (far-away things are smaller) in 2D gives the brain the illusion of 3D
  * **Stereoscopic vision** provides sense of depth
    * A flat image of a scene can look like the same experience of looking at the actual scene in-person
    * The eyes gets 2 images from slightly different angles to get the sense of depth
* "computer graphics is a mean by which we can create images of artificial worlds and present them to the brain (through the mean of vision), as an experience of reality"
  * I thought this was pretty 深い
  * **Photorealism**

## Describing Objects Making up the Virtual World
* Unlike humans, computers need an explicit description of the image to render it
  * One way: points or **coordinates** relative to an **origin** in a 3D coordinate system
