## A Gentle Introduction to Computer Graphics Programming
* We live in a 3D world, but our **vision** views this world in 2D (images, flat screen, mirror)
  * **Foreshortening** (far-away things are smaller) in 2D gives the brain the illusion of 3D
  * **Stereoscopic vision** provides sense of depth
    * A flat image of a scene can look like the same experience of looking at the actual scene in-person
    * The eyes gets 2 images from slightly different angles to get the sense of depth
* "computer graphics is a mean by which we can create images of artificial worlds and present them to the brain (through the mean of vision), as an experience of reality"
  * I thought this was pretty Ê∑±„ÅÑ
  * **Photorealism**

## Describing Objects Making up the Virtual World
* Unlike humans, computers need an explicit description of the image to render it
* **Rendering**: create a image from a 3D scene
  * One way: points or **coordinates** relative to an **origin** in a 3D coordinate system
![A box in 3D space](images/it-is-a-box.png)
* Describe box with an array of `Point`: `Point(width, height, depth)`

```python
points = [
    Point(0, 0,  0),    # corner 1
    Point(12, 0,  0),   # corner 2
    Point(12, 8,  0),   # corner 3
    Point(0, 8,  0),    # corner 4
    Point(0, 0, 10),    # corner 5
    Point(12, 0, 10),   # corner 6
    Point(12, 8, 10),   # corner 7 
    Point(0, 8, 10),    # corner 8
]
```

* To render an image, we need:
  1. **scene**: a collection of these object descriptions (ex. `list[Point]` is a scene)
        <img src="images/box-step-1.png" width=100px>
  2. **topology**: instructions on how to connect these points to produce the faces/flat surfaces of the box (a **model**) <img src="images/box-step-2.png" width=100px>
     * Points are also called **vertices**
     * Any collection of flat surfaces that we are trying to create with these vertices = **polygons**
       * Ex. a bunch of flat triangles
     * These polygons form a **polygonal mesh**, **mesh**
       * Ex. The box is a polygonal mesh, made up of rectangles as its flat faces (polygons)
  3. A system that will project the image onto an imaginary canvas <img src="images/box-step-3.png" width=200px>
     * **perspective projection**

## Creating an Image of this Virtual World
How to take 3D points and project them onto a 2D canvas.
* Use a **perspective matrix** to compute
* **Viewing frustum** pyramid, 3D volume in space, your field of vision
  * The **canvas** is a flat plane cutting through the viewing frustum (pyramid), perpendicular to your line of sight
![Viewing Frustum](images/viewing-frustum.png)
1. Place box in front of viewing frustum. Draw lines from each corner of the box to the origin (eye)
![Frustum lines overview](images/frustum-lines-overview.png)

2. See where the lines intersect the canvas
![Frustum lines intersect](images/frustum-lines-intersect.png)

3. Connect the intersection points on the canvas. We see a 2D image!
![Frustum lines connect](images/frustum-lines-connect-2d.png)

This coordinate system = **world coordinate system**, with origin at `(0,0,0)`.

Since we moved the box from the origin, its coordinates have changed:
```python
points = [
    Point(1, -1, -5)    # corner 1 
    Point(1, -1, -3)    # corner 2
    Point(1, 1, -5)     # corner 3
    Point(1, 1, -3)     # corner 4
    Point(-1, -1, -5)   # corner 5
    Point(-1, -1, -3)   # corner 6
    Point(-1,  1, -5)   # corner 7
    Point(-1,  1, -3)   # corner 8
]
```
Width, height, and depth can be negative!

### How to calculate the projected coordinates on the canvas
Move canvas 1 unit away from the origin. Looking at the side-view of our box, we can draw a triangle from the box to the origin:

![Side-view of box](images/side-view.png)

We want to find point `P'` because this is where one corner of the box (`corner #8`) intersects the canvas when we draw a line between `corner #8` to the origin `A`. We need `P'.y`:
```
P' = Point(x=P'.x, y=P'.y, z=1)
```

We have two *similar* triangles: `ABC` and `AB'C'`. A property of **similar triangles**: the proportion of the adjacent and opposite sides are the same.

![Similar triangles](images/similar-triangles.png)

**Z divide**, or the **perspective divide**: the projection of the y-coordinate of a box corner `P` onto the 2D canvas is: `P.y` divided by its depth `P.z` (the z-coordinate).
* This also applies to the x-coordinate
  * But we need to divide `P.x` and `P.y` with `-P.z` (negative), otherwise it would compute a mirrored coordinate

3D point `P(x, y, z)` -> 2D point `P'(x, y)`
* `P'.x = P.x / -P.z`
* `P'.y = P.y / -P.z`

### Canvas size, normalization, convert to another image size
* The canvas size effects how much of the scene you see.
* The shape is arbitrary (can rectangle, square)
* Any points outside the canvas would not be seen in the 2D image
    * Projected points inside the canvas = in **screen space**
* To be able to adjust to any screen size (and not work with negative coordinate values), we **normalize** the project points to the range `[0,1]` so that the coordinates are defined in a common space.
* Coordinates of range `[-1, 1]` are **Normalized Device Coordinates** (NDC)
* The projected coordinates should be in the unit of the final image, such as **pixels**.
  * An image is simply a 2D array of pixels
* Screen resolution (1080p = 1092x1080, 1080 pixels is the height)

To convert the NDC coordinates to an image of 512x512 pixels, multiply the NDC coordinate by 512 pixels.
* This creates coordinates in a **raster space**
  * Raster images are made of pixels (`.png`, `.jpeg`) and are resolution-dependent
  * Vector images (`.svg`) are not resolution-dependent, so they can be stretched to arbitrary sizes and not "blur"

## What have we learned? 
* The rules for creating an image is purely mathematics. The computer is simply a tool to speed up the computation
* **Real-time rendering**: images need to be generated at least 30 frames per second (fps) (60 fps is the standard)
  * Computed by GPU
  * Requirement for video games
* **Offline rendering**: images are pre-computed and stored before being displayed at whatever frames per second
  * Typically produces better quality images than real-time rendering
  * CGI for films

* Rendering (read "Volume 1: Foundations of 3D Rendering" on [Scratchapixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/index.php?redirect)) in chronological order

## Questions
* Why is the canvas not the end image? (why do we need to do another computation, ex. multiply by `512` for a `512x512` image)
