## [Motion Blur](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)

The **motion blur effect** is created by averaging the images of what the camera sees over a time interval
* Method originally introduced by [Rob Cook in 1984](https://graphics.pixar.com/library/DistributedRayTracing/)
* Generate rays at random times within some time interval

Went on some rabbit hole and found someone who [rendered black holes](https://rantonels.github.io/starless/).
