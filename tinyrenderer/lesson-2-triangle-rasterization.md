## Filling Triangles

### Old-school Method: Line sweeping
We can use our line implementation to draw a triangle:

```cpp
void triangle(std::vector<Point> t, TGAImage& image, TGAColor color) {
    line(t[0], t[1], image, color);
    line(t[1], t[2], image, color);
    line(t[2], t[0], image, color);
}
```

Einfach! Now how to draw a *filled* triangle? ...

**Naive Attempt 1**

Pick a corner of a triangle, and from that corner, draw a point to every point in the base of the triangle.

I modified the line drawing algorithm to return all the points that were used to draw the line.

There are still holes in the triangle... (looks funky-ly cool though)

**Naive Attempt 2**

Choose the longest side, and draw lines from the other two sides

Still full of holes...

One side:

![Half filled 1](images/filled_triangle_attempt_2_half1.png)

The other side:

![Half filled 2](images/filled_triangle_attempt_2_half2.png)

Both halves:

![Full filled](images/filled_triangle_attempt_2_full.png)

Returning the Points that were used to draw a line is a waste of memory too...

**Better Way**

Using only straight lines to fill a triangle would guarentee not to have small gaps inside the triangle ðŸ’¡

We first sort the three points of the triangle by increasing y-coordinate: `t0`, `t1`, `t2`. Then draw the following lines:
* `t0` --- `t1`
* `t1` --- `t2`
* `t2` --- `t0`

We can label the triangle into two parts: `A`and `B`:

![Triangle line filling](images/triangle_line_filling.png)

`A` has the tallest height (since we connected the points with the highest y-coordinate and the lowest y-coordinate). We can then split the height with the two other sides into segments, both labelled `B`.

First let's only look at the first segment `B`, from `t0` --- `t1`:

![Triangle line filling zoomed](images/triangle_line_filling_zoomed.png)

What we are doing here is increasing `y` by 1 incrementally at each step. At each step, we check what percentage of of the total segment height we are at: `beta`. And also what percentage of the total height of the triangle we are at: `alpha`.

At a given `y`, we get the percentages `alpha` and `beta`. We use `beta` to find the x-coordinate of the point that is `beta` percent of the segment's width.

For example, let's say at a given `y` we are 30% of the total segment, so `beta` = 30%. We use this percentage to find the x-coordinate that is 30% of the total segment width:

![Triangle line filling horizontal](images/triangle_line_filling_horizontal.png)

We do the same thing for finding the x-coordinate for the point on `A`.

Because the y-coordinate is the same for the point on segment `B` and the point on `A`, we can then draw a straight horizontal line between these points.

Some bugs ðŸª²:
```cpp
for (int y=0; y<t[1].y; y++) { // <--- need to start at t[0].y, not 0
    float alpha = y / total_height; // <--- need to divide (t0.y - y); use float
    float beta = y / segment_height; // 
    //...
}
```

Fixed! âœ¨

**Filling the top half**

Some bugs ðŸª²:

Naively did the same thing as the bottom segment for the top segment (just adjusting which points to use):

![Incorrect fill triangle](images/triangle_line_filling_bug2.png)

Draws a horizontally flipped version of the intended triangle...

Account for decreasing x-coordinate as y increases:
```cpp
// x-coordinate on upper B segment
int b_dx = (t[2].x - t[1].x);
int bx = 0;
if (b_dx >= 0) {
    bx = t[0].x + b_dx*beta;
} else {
    // The segment's x-coordinate decreases as the y-coordinate increases
    bx = t[0].x + b_dx*(1-beta);
}
```

Still a wierd mess:

![Still incorrect](images/triangle_line_filling_bug3.png)

`alpha` should still a percentage of the height of `A`:

```cpp
float alpha = (float)(y - t[0].y) / total_height;
```

![Still incorrect](images/triangle_line_filling_bug4.png)

Started the segment's x-coordinate at `t0` instead of `t1`:
```cpp
int bx = t[0].x + (t[2].x - t[1].x)*beta; // <-- need to use t1. + ...
```

Also removed the negative slope handling.

Fixed!! âœ¨

![Both halves filled](images/triangle_line_filling_half_horizontal_top.png)

Interestingly we do not have to check for a negative slope for the segments when computing the x-coordinate. When the line has a negative slope, the segments width is negative, which naturally decreases the x-coordinate as the y-coordinate increases.

**Cleanup**

Combined the two loops into one, and manually drew the line instead of using `line()` since we know that it is a straight line (no need to calculate error, etc);
```cpp
// Draw a straight line    
if (ax > bx) std::swap(ax, bx); 
for (int x=ax; x<=bx; x++) {
    image.set(x, y, color); 
}
```

**Understanding Barycentric coordinates**

[This document](https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~zwood/teaching/csc471/2017F/barycentric.pdf) was a very good explanation of Barycentric coordinates. The following are notes from that document.

*Barycentric coordinates* are coordinates defined to be relative to a set of chosen coordinates.

zB If we have a triangle of three points, `a`, `b`, `c`, then a Point `p` would be defined in relation to `a`, `b`, `c`. We use constants to define this relation.

We create a coordinate system with basis vector `a->c`, and `a->b`.

We go in the `a->c` direction with some constant gamma `Î³`, and the `a->b` direction with some constant beta `Î²`:

![Points on a plane](images/barycentric-coordinates-plane.png)

We can then use the constants `Î³` and `Î²` to define where point `p` is on this plane.

Let's try to get `p` in terms of the points `a`, `b`, and `c`.

We can think of getting to point `p` from point `a`, using the basis vectors `a->b` and `a->c`:
```
p = a + Î²*(a->b) +  Î³*(a->c)
```

We can also represent a vector as a subtraction of two points:

```
p = a + Î²*(b-a) +  Î³*(c-a)
```

Distribute the constants:
```
p = a + Î²*b - Î²*a + Î³*c - Î³*a
```

Rearrange the terms:
```
p = a - Î²*a - Î³*a + Î²*b + Î³*c
```

Now we get point `p` in terms of points `a`, `b`, and `c`:
```
p = (1 - Î² - Î³)*a + Î²*b + Î³*c 
```

We rewrite the coefficient of `a` with alpha `Î±`:
```
Î± = 1 - Î² - Î³ 
```

Then we can rewrite the equation:
```
p = Î±*a + Î²*b + Î³*c 
```

The coefficients `Î±`, `Î²` and `Î³` have the constraint that they must add to 1:
```
Î± + Î² + Î³ = 1
```

We can plot various points on this plane to see how the coeffiicents change:

![Barycentric coordinates coefficients](images/barycentric-coordinates-derivation_points.png)

We can see how the coefficients tell us where a point is relative to the triangle created by points `a`, `b`, and `c`!

#### Finding the coefficients
We need to find the coeffients `Î²` and `Î³` that represent point `p`.

No matter what point `p` we choose, the following vectors add up to zero:
```
Î²*(a->b) + Î³*(a->c) + (p->a) = 0
```

![Triangle vectors add up to zero](images/triangle-vectors-add-to-zero.png)

We can set up that equation to find the x and y coordinate of `p` in terms of `Î²` and `Î³`:

```
Î²*(a->b)_x + Î³*(a->c)_x + (p->a)_x = 0
Î²*(a->b)_y + Î³*(a->c)_y + (p->a)_y = 0
```

`(a->b)_x` means the x-component of the vector `(a->b)`.

(from now on we will use `u` for `Î²` and `v` for `Î³` to follow the tinyrenderer docs).

We can rewrite the above equations in matrix form:

![Solve triangle in matrix form](images/solve-triangle-matrix.png)

If we multiply the matrix out, we can see that it is equivalent to the equation we had above:

![Mutliply matrix out](images/multiply-matrix-out.png)

This particular matrix multiply is actually equivalent to the dot product. And we know that if the dot product is 0, then the two vectors are *orthogonal* to each other!

In other words, the vector we are trying to find `[u, v, 1]` is perpendicular to `[(A->B), (A->C), (P->A)]`.
